                    Attending college or university can be an opportunity to grow your mind, social circle, and understanding of the world and your place in it. However, for many, college also means swapping the comforts of home for a new routine—and with that change can come mental health challenges. <br><br>

                    Studies show that mental health issues are becoming increasingly common among college students, but the good news is there are ways to protect your mental well-being. Below, we offer advice on how to manage stress and prioritize your mental health as a college student so you can make the most of your college experience. <br><br></p>
                    <p class="justify"><b>Tips for taking care of your mental health</b></p>

                    <p class="justify">Finding your groove at school may take a bit of time. Below are some of top tips for addressing stress and other mental health challenges as you navigate college life:<br><br>
                        1. Create a self-care routine<br><br>
                        Between classes, clubs, and creating new friendships, it can be tough to find the time to prioritize self-care, but a healthy routine is key to maintaining positive mental health. Self-care is all about taking time to focus on yourself so that your body and mind have an opportunity to rest. Exercising, sleeping, journaling, and eating a balanced diet are all simple ways to help build resilience<br><br>

                        2. Start small with one mental health commitment<br><br>
                        If incorporating an entire self-care practice into your routine sounds more stressful than helpful, try starting small. Maybe this means taking a morning walk on your college campus to improve concentration and reduce anxiety. Perhaps you reduce your caffeine intake in order to feel less jittery and help you sleep better. It could be as basic as making a point to shower and get dressed for the day each morning. The goal is to foster small but significant habits that support your mental and physical health so you’re prepared to tackle whatever comes your way.<br><br>

                        3. Stay organized<br><br>
                        Organization can help students to feel in control of their circumstances and environment. When it comes to schoolwork, use a planner to keep track of important assignments, due dates, and project milestones so that you don’t find yourself stressing over the uncertainty of deadlines. A planner can also help you manage extracurriculars and allows you an opportunity to schedule in some “me time” throughout the week as well.<br><br>

                        4. Think beyond graduation<br><br>
                        For the first time, the U.S. Surgeon General is advising Americans to think about how the workplace can influence their mental health. The guidance reviews how long hours and limited autonomy can disrupt sleep and lead to mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. When thinking about your career path and job prospects, consider pursuing growth opportunities that prioritize community, work-life balance, protection from harm, and employee involvement in workplace decisions.<br><br>

                        5. Know when and where to find mental health support<br><br>
                        Sometimes self-care alone isn’t enough to help college students adjust to their new surroundings and manage their stress. That’s where therapy can help. Whether it’s homesickness, social anxiety, or something more severe, speaking with a mental health professional is a great way to unpack your feelings, better understand symptoms, and find ways to cope.<br><br>
                        That's all from the tips above. Have a good day and take care of your health.
